# Vim AppImage Repository

This is a project for building a 64bit Gvim AppImage from the latest Vim snapshots.
AppImage is a form of cross-distribution packaging format that can be run
everywhere by simply downloading the image and starting it. For more
information about the package format see here: [AppImage](https://appimage.org).

The image is based on Ubuntu ~~18.04 LTS bionic~~ 20.04 LTS bionic (since PR #47,
because Github retired the Ubuntu 18.04 images in April 2023)

It most likely won't work on older distributions. If you require a Vim appimage,
that runs on older distributions, you can download the latest Ubuntu 18.04 based
installation [here: v9.0.1413](https://github.com/vim/vim-appimage/releases/tag/v9.0.1413)

[Download](https://github.com/vim/vim-appimage/releases) and execute the
most recent `GVim-*.AppImage` file to run GVim.

If you want a terminal Vim, just create a symbolic link with a name starting with "vim". Like:
```
ln -s GVim-*.AppImage vim.appimage
```

Then start `vim.appimage` to get a terminal Vim.

The vim / gvim AppImage's are built with Vim interfaces for Perl, Python3, Ruby
and Lua. See the release notes for usage and details.
